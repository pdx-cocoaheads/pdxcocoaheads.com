    <p>The Portland CocoaHeads group is devoted to discussion of Apple's Cocoa Framework for programming on Mac OS X and iOS devices. During our regularly scheduled meetings (Discussion Night) members of all experience levels have a moderated group discussion on a given topic. When we have a presenter we will have an additional meeting for the month where a presenter (a PDX-Cocoaheads member or out-of-towner) will give a presentation on their topic of choice lecture/tutorial style. Developers using any Cocoa-related language (Swift, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, javascript, etc.) are welcome.</p>

    <p>Discussion Night meetings are held on the 2nd Wednesday of the month. Presentation Night meetings are held on a month-to-month basis. Head to our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PDX-iOS-CocoaHeads/">meetup.com page</a> to sign up for notifications of new meetings and last minute updates.</p>
